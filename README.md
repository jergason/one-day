* Be able to consistency focus on doing hard things instead of spending so much
  time on entertainment or distraction
* Plan out a list of important things to do, and do them quickly

This one needs a bit more detail I think. I tend to come up with a list of a
few things to do, and then that small list of things to do, no matter how
small, seems like the maximum amount of things I can get done in a day. I'd like
to be able to focus and crank through these things more rapidly instead of letting
the work expand to fill the time allotted for it. This shows up especially in
conference talks, where I am freaking out and prepping and studying and practicing
and tweaking slides right up until the moment when the day of the talk.

* Prepare for a talk in advance instead of right up until it is due
* Accomplish something in less than the maximum amount of time I can spend on it

* Be better at clearly expressing myself in confrontational situations

This one still seems to vague. The problem is, I don't express how I am actually
feeling in stressful situation. I want to avoid pissing people off or saying
dumb things. Part of this is I just take a while to process things and think
of how to respond.



I'm not sure how detailed or high-level to make these, and I'm not sure how many
of them I should have. It seems like the effectiveness of them would diminish
if I had like 30 of them. It also seems like these are very vague and hard to
measure. I think I'll tweak these a bit to make them a bit more actionable.
