* Gracefully accept compliments.
* Finish books/talks.
* Be better at clearly expressing myself in confrontational situations, like
  negotiation or disagreement.
* Plan out a list of important things to do, and do them quickly.

  This one needs a bit more detail I think. I tend to come up with a list of a
  few things to do, and then that small list of things to do, no matter how
  small, seems like the maximum amount of things I can get done in a day. I'd
  like to be able to focus and crank through these things more rapidly instead
  of letting the work expand to fill the time allotted for it. This shows up
  especially in conference talks, where I am freaking out and prepping and
  studying and practicing and tweaking slides right up until the moment when
  the day of the talk.

* Accomplish something in less than the maximum amount of time I can spend on it
